# 🧠 DSA – Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This is a collaborative repository where we solve and track problems related to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**, focused entirely on **LeetCode**. Our goal is to strengthen our algorithmic thinking, prepare for coding interviews, and improve performance on coding challenges.

---

## ✅ Purpose

- Practice and master key DSA topics  
- Track solved problems from LeetCode  
- Write clean, efficient, and well-documented Java solutions  
- Collaborate, learn, and grow together  

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Browse the problems we’ve solved  
2. Open the Java file for a clean solution with comments  
3. Learn from time/space complexity and edge case handling

Each solution includes:
- Clean Java implementation  
- Time & space complexity  
- LeetCode performance stats  
- Edge case handling
